* Code Refactoring
*Refactoring* 
  Using existing code (tried to improve it without changing what it does) to meet a certain set of standards or to implement a new technology is a common task for front-end and junior developers. For this particular homework assignment, a marketing agency has asked refactor an existing site to make it more accessible. 

**Important Note** 

***This layout is designed for desktop viewing, so notice that some of the elements don't look like the mock-up at a resolution smaller than 768px. Eventually will have to make elements responsive so that your web application is optimized for any screen size.
***The layout is different from the mock up provide inorder to provide ease of navigation althrough the site.
***The content is given more important than the graphic itself.
**Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

## Mock-Up

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
